### Background of the Study
Tourism’s role in economic development is dependent on the tourists’ perceptions, attitudes, and experiences toward the destinations they visit, and these factors directly influence travel decisions and destination selection, making them critical for sustainable tourism growth [(Brida et al., 2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0261517720300571). One of the main considerations for tourists in choosing a travel destination is the perceived quality and implementation of safety measures. The presence of well-enforced safety protocols can enhance the appeal of a tourist site, boosting tourist confidence and repeat visits, which in turn strengthens the tourism sector.

Travelers are more inclined to avoid areas perceived as hazardous. This means that in high-risk tourist destinations, risk and safety management is important. Effective risk management helps strengthen a destination’s image by developing and implementing policies that promote safety, which in turn boosts the site’s brand equity and appeal. A well-maintained destination image is essential for attracting international and domestic tourists, as it reflects tourists’ collective perceptions, experiences, and evaluations of a location [(Mercado & Apritado, 2021)](https://research.lpubatangas.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/m7732_ijrsm_final.pdf).
Hinulugang Taktak Protected Landscape, a popular tourist destination in Antipolo City, Philippines, integrates tourism and conservation efforts. Known as a summer retreat where locals from nearby areas gather for recreation, this protected landscape benefits from its status under the Expanded National Integrated Protected Areas System (ENIPAS) Act, or Republic Act 11038 [(Congress of the Philippines, 2017)](https://legacy.senate.gov.ph/republic_acts/ra%2011038.pdf). However, several risks pose challenges to this attraction, such as infrastructure vulnerabilities and the presence of settlements along riverbanks that threaten the natural environment. Additionally, natural disasters, including earthquakes, landslides, and soil erosion, create ongoing safety concerns for visitors [(Eden, 2022)](https://haraya.upca.upd.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Eden.pdf). This may harm the reputation of the landscape to both local and foreign visitors.

Therefore, it is critical to determine and assess effective safety measures given these threats to the landscape in the perspective of the tourist. Risk indicators for tourist destinations lead to the development of safety protocols in different aspects such as emergency response, natural disaster mitigation, infrastructure, and general safety guidelines. Emergency safety measures involve strategies for proactive incident response, including positioning security personnel and ensuring staff are well-trained to handle potential hazards [(Vaiagae, 2020)](https://scholarworks.waldenu.edu/dissertations/8342/). Natural disaster risk mitigation involves designated evacuation routes and safe zones within high-risk areas, while infrastructure safety measures address facility quality and accessibility to ensure a safe environment for visitors of all ages. General safety practices include placing warning signs and maintaining quality equipment to prevent accidents.

This study aims to assess tourist perceptions of safety measures at Hinulugang Taktak, focusing on emergency/incident response, natural disaster preparedness, infrastructure safety, and general safety protocols. Furthermore, it seeks to identify safety-related challenges experienced by visitors. Based on the findings, the study will propose guidelines to enhance the safety and reputation of Hinulugang Taktak, contributing to both the site’s long-term appeal and the broader knowledge of tourism safety management in the Philippines.

### Theoretical Framework
This study uses the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to determine tourist perceptions on safety measures at Hinulugang Taktak and explain how these perceptions influence their intention to visit. It is developed by Ajzen (1991) and is a widely recognized framework on psychology for understanding the relationship between individual’s perception, attitude, and behavior. It has three primary constructs namely: attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control that shapes an individual’s behavioral intentions and behavior as shown in Figure 1.

### Conceptual Framework
The study used the Input-Process-Output (IPO) model to outline key variables of the study. The IPO model comprises of three main phases: Input, Process, and Output as shown in Figure 2.

The Input consists of the demographic profile of the tourists visiting in Hinulugang Taktak in terms of age, sex, and civil status, and the safety measures in in terms of emergency and incident preparedness, natural disaster readiness, and infrastructure and facility safety.

The Process comprises the creation, validation, distribution, and retrieval of survey questionnaires. Statistical analysis of the gathered data is also included in the Process. 

The Output contains the tourist’s perception and problems encountered on the safety measure in Hinulugang Taktak.

The Feedback serves as a feedback loop from the Output to the In  put. It includes tourist comments, suggestions and recommendations on the safety measures in Hinulugang Taktak.

### Statement of the Problem
Tourism is considered as one of the driving force of national economy. However, the industry is dependent on a tourist's decision for selecting a travel destination. One of the factors that influence this decision is the tourist perception on the implementation of safety measures in the tourist spot. Because of this, there is a need to determine the assessment of safety measures from a tourist's perspective. To add, studies on safety measures at local tourist destinations in the Philippines remains limited.                             

The objective of this study is to fill this gap by determining tourist perceptions of safety measures at Hinulugang Taktak focusing on three key themes: emergency/incident preparedness, natural disaster readiness, infrastructure facility and safety. The study also aims to determine the problems encountered by tourists on the overall general safety measures of the place. By evaluating these areas, the study seeks to provide insights that can guide improvements in local safety standards, and in turn, enhance the site's reputation to both domestic and international tourists.

The study addresses the following research questions:  
1.	What is the socio-demographic profile of tourists visiting Hinulugang Taktak in terms of age and sex?
2.	What is the tourist perception on safety measures at Hinulugang Taktak regarding:
    1. Emergency and incident preparedness,
    2. Natural disaster readiness,
    3. Infrastructure and facility safety?
3.	What are the safety-measure problems do tourists encounter during their visit to Hinulugang Taktak?
4.	Based on the findings of the study, what are the proposed safety measure guidelines to strengthen safety protocols at Hinulugang Taktak?
### Assumption
Assumptions are conditions, or premises the researcher believes to be true without concrete proof for the study's purposes. These are facts or events a researcher assumes true without verification from a researcher. This study operates under the following assumptions:
1. The study assumes that all participants will answer the survey questionnaire honestly and to the best of their knowledge. The accuracy of findings is dependent on the truthful response since the study relies on self-reported data.
2. The study assumes that the survey instrument used in this study are reliable and valid for capturing tourists' perceptions of safety measures. The contents of the survey is based on established literature for accuracy on the measurement of the intended variables.
3. The study assumes that the tourists participating in this study have sufficient awareness and familiarity with the implemented safety measures at Hinulugang Taktak.
4. The study assumes that external factors such as weather conditions, local events, or sudden changes will not alter the conditions of Hinulugang Taktak during the study period.
### Scope and Delimitation of the Study
The scope of this study is limited to tourists visiting Hinulugang Taktak during the data collection period. Only tourists who have visited the location for the past month will be included to ensure relevance and accuracy in reporting their current perceptions. The study will gather data using survey questionnaires distributed to tourists at the site focusing on their experiences on the safety measures of the place.

The study is further confined to the following specific aspects:  
  1.	The study will only focus on safety measures related to emergency preparedness, natural disaster risks, and infrastructure, and will not explore other aspects of tourism management or the general tourism experience from Hinulugang Taktak.  
  2.	The study will only collect data from tourists aging 15 and above and is visiting the site during the study period.  
  3.	The study will only focus on Hinulugang Taktak in Antipolo City, excluding other nearby tourist spots or regions in the Philippines.

The delimitations of the study are as follows:  
  1.	The study does not include other tourist destinations within the nearby tourist spots, in the Philippines, or internationally as it only focuses on Hinulugang Taktak.  
  2.	The data collection method of this study is limited only to self-reported responses through surveys, whose report may be influenced by the respondent's biases or subjective interpretations.  
  3.	The sample size will be limited to a manageable number of respondents from the site due to resource constraints, which may not fully represent the broader population of tourists who visit Hinulugang Taktak.  

These delimitations is to maintain the feasibility of the study within the constraints of time and resources and its findings will be most applicable only to Hinulugang Taktak and may not be fully generalizable to other tourist destinations.
