		Purpose and Objectives
			investigating the acceptability and tourism risk impact on the destination image of the Province of Batangas
			determine the tourist risk impact on the destination image in terms of: manmade, natural disasters, tourist benefit, feeling experience and destination image;
		Context and Background
			tourism as major driver of economic and social progress
			majority of tourist destinations are disrupted due to COVID-19, a global epidemic
			high risk tourism destinations are avoided due to perceived risks and hazards
			understanding tourist attitude and concern towards destination plays an important role in sustainable tourism
			international tourists develop a favorable relationship between tourism risk and destination image
			the risks evident in tourist destinations have been a growing concern of tourism organizations, employees, and tourists
			these risks can make or break the destination image
		Theoretical Framework
			None
			Ritchie et al. (2010) cited that disastrous event together with the adverse effects would economically threaten, weaken or destroy the competitiveness of tourist destinations.
		Methodology
			descriptive method research design
			437 tourists from top 10 tourist destinations by PTCAO
			sampled using availability sampling
			data gathering instrument is adapted questionnaire
			descriptive statistical tools: frequency count, percentage, weighted mean
		Key Findings
			there is an impact on the destination image present with natural disasters
			occurrence of natural disaster may deter touristsâ€™ travel intentions
			high risk of disaster in the destination discourages respondents from visiting it
			damage from natural disasters affects their travel desire
			risk of natural disaster has a negative effect on my choice for location
		Conclusions and Implications
			there is tourist risk impact on the destination image on natural disasters, man-made, tourist benefit, destination image, and feeling experience. 
			highly significant correlation between the impact of risk to tourist destination and tourist risk impact on the destination image
		Limitations
			None
		Recommendations
			improving safety and security or tourist destinations
			tourism business may incorporate strategic programs or security systems
			*proposed guidelines
		Unique Insights or Novel Contributions
			None
