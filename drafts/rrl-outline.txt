		Purpose and Objectives
			investigated the safety and security measures of resorts in batangas
			to determine the level of safety and security in terms of public hazard, life and property, environmental security, public health, and accessibility
			assessed the guest satisfaction in terms of facilities/ amenities and customer service
		Context and Background
			safety and security are important factors to tourists when choosing a destination and when selecting a hotel to stay in
			resorts are one of the main contributory factors of the growing economy of Batangas
			resort owners should intentionally focus on every single detail of the safety security to keep their guests from all dangers otherwise it will be a negative image of their hotels in case there are any accidents or unexpected incidents to the tourists
			there is still a lack of research that evaluates the safety and security measures from guests' viewpoint in the resort industry in general themselves or their belongings
		Theoretical Framework
			None
		Methodology
			descriptive method of research
			279 respondents
			data gathering instrument is a survey questionnaire
			descriptive statistics and anova for data analysis
		Key Findings
			public hazards
				checkpoints and presence of security personnel
				providing expert tourist guides and lifeguards
			life and property
				resorts does not allow tourists to bring any deadly weapon
			public health
				tourists are being served with clean and safe food
			accessibility
				provides signage and brochures for risk reduction
			environmental security
				feeling safe and secured in water and air pollution and from natural catastrophic events
			guest satisfaction
				clean rooms and facilities
				providing appropriate time and service is necessary as amenities
		Conclusions and Implications
			the resort managers should be genuinely involved in safety and security programs because this practice could potentially enhance the public reputation of the resort
		Limitations
		Recommendations
			the resort managers should be genuinely involved in safety and security programs because this practice could potentially enhance the public reputation of the resort
			the management may invest advanced security technologies to facilitate the security of guests

		Purpose and Objectives
			aimed to assess the extent of disaster risk management preparedness of a local beach and dive resort in Southern Negros Occidental
		Context and Background
			Disaster risk management preparedness in tourism destinations is significant for social change, reducing disaster-induced fear and removing the adverse effect of crises
			the tourism industry needs deeper and more thorough planning and management, including Disaster Risk Management planning
			there are not enough empirical studies conducted in Negros Occidental that focus on the disaster risk management preparedness of a local beach and dive resort
		Theoretical Framework
			Theory of Planned Behavior by Ajzen (1991)
			Theory of emergency management
		Methodology
			descriptive approach, quantitative research design
			87 local tourism players (DRRM Staff, Tourism office employees, community leaders, beach and dive resort personnel, and tourists)
			researcher-made questionnaire and structured interview as research instruments
			mean and standard deviation as data analysis for the questionnaires
		Key Findings
			resort management performed a great extent of disaster risk management preparedness in typhoon/flood
			the extent of disaster preparedness of the resort in earthquake/landslide is higher than the extent of disaster preparedness in typhoons/floods
			man-made hazards, the extent of disaster preparedness of the resort in crime and terrorism is higher than health threat events.
		Conclusions and Implications
			the resort was able to mitigate the hazard which would provide safety of the personnel and tourists
			disaster risk management preparedness for natural and man-made hazards were critical to the disaster risk management preparedness of a local beach and dive resort
		Limitations
			limited number of respondents were obtained
			the actual conduct of this study was done during a pandemic
			result may differ from a larger number 
		Recommendations
			assess the resort management resiliency on the hazards they experienced
			study to be replicated requires a greater number of respondents
			to be conducted in the different cities and municipalities
