4. General Risks and Safety Problems
	Foreign RRL (Nagaj & a Žuromskaite, 2020) https://www.mdpi.com/1911-8074/13/5/99
		Purpose and Objectives
			to assess whether the level of competitiveness of accommodation facilities results from the level of safety and security provided to consumers of these services, measured by the number of security measures applied in them
			to assess whether the level of competitiveness in the tourism sector, more specifically of accommodation facilities, resulted from the level of security provided to consumers of these services, measured by the number of security measures applied in them
		Context and Background
			tourism is the fastest growing economic sectors in the world
			every issue of security that has a direct impact on tourists has a negative impact on income and tourist attendance of particular tourist destinations
			to ensure that tourism continues to develop and generate income for tourist regions participants of this sector should focus on safety and security of their customers because people are risk-averse
			tourists want to feel relatively safe in tourist destinations and accommodation facilities
			*list of all security measures from Ghazi (2015)
		Theoretical Framework
			None
		Methodology
			location of the study is from two counties, Poland and Lithuania due to low security risks
			85 accommodation services for Swinoujscie and 56 for Klaipeda
			Herfindahl–Hirscham Index (HHI) used to find the concentration and find the level of security measures of accommodation facilities
		Key Findings
			security measures implemented in Swinoujscie
				fire extinguishers
				CCTV outside property
				guest elevators
				private parking
			Klaipeda
				transfer to/from the airport
				private parking
				24-h front desk
				smoke detectors
			Both
				car parking facility
			there is a positive correlation between star ratings and the level of security measures installed in the facility
			the accommodation facilities rarely applied all 13 security measures analyzed
			the more stars the facility had, the more security measures were installed 
		Conclusions and Implications
			the owners of such facilities not to treat the level of security offered as a pricing factor, but rather as an element of service quality that could be used in advertising their business
			should also help the owners of accommodation facilities to improve the quality of their services
		Limitations
			None
		Recommendations
			They are informed about how many safety measures and which of them they should install in their accommodation facilities if they want to remain competitive in the market or what they should do to improve their services to obtain more “stars”
			some security measures are seen by tourists as a security requirement in accommodation facilities
